        <p class="light">
          Open Source contact form micro service for those who don't need a dynamic website. We offer a hosted version of this service for $2 a month which includes unlimited messages. A common reason clients request platforms like Wordpress is to bootstrap their online presence and provide an online contact form for client communication. The truth is for the average small business platforms like Wordpress can be too much tool for the job. What they really need is a beautiful website with some basic features one of which is a client contact form. With SavvyMailer your need for a contact form no longer has to define your web platform.
