Recently twitter had a hashtag inviting use to describe of our first 7 jobs. It was a lot of fun to see how my peers had started their lives. Mine went a little something like this:
1. Food worker at an Amusement Park
2. Gas station attendant
3. Box boy at a supermarket
4. Box boy at a dollar store
5. Tutor/Educational Support Tech
6. Web Developer at a Small Consultancy
7. Software Developer at a Product Company

To a casual observer it appears that at some point I started working in tech and then it escalated rapidly. What if I told you that #5 happened during college you might conclude that college was the impetus for my future success. The thing this list doesn't describe is that during jobs 1-5 I was programming in my off hours, we grow up to be the sum of experiences. Every great developer I have ever met has been writing code and building things before anyone paid them to do so. That is why the tech industry respects passion just as much as it respect education. That doesn't make Tech special. You can have passion for selling cars, an oft maligned profession, which is probably a better indicator of success than that of a MBA.

I have spent my life building websites and web applications. It has been an amazing run so far. I have seen the burst of the .com bubble, that didn't really burst. Now I am watching the rise of the IoT universe and enjoying the ride. This might change in the future but I doubt it. Optimism is the nature of tech and the beauty of Open Source. It is this optimism that has keep me in for the long haul. So passion rewarded leads to optimism and optimism leads to us trying to build a better world for everyone else. I have yet to work for a company that didn't have a pro bono passion project in their community that they dedicated themselves to. This wasn't done for a PR kick or a Tax Shelter it was done for the sake of doing.

In my lifetime I have seen enormous corruption and suffering as I launch SavvySoftWorks I hope that I will always be able to combat this with passion and optimism. I will make my community a better place and I will convince others to do the same. In the mean time I will be a web developer.
